# Oh dear #

We should probably add something in here.

## Get Started(ish) ##

1. First! You'll need to install a couple of gems:
```
gem install soloist
gem install librarian
```
2. Then you'll want to download the two files from [this gist](https://gist.github.com/4625242) into your home directory.
3. From your home directory run `librarian-chef install` which will install `1kb_workstation` into ~/cookbooks
4. Run `soloist` which will prompt for a sudo password and then install some stuff.
5. Celebrate. Unless everything went sideways. In which case, don't.
